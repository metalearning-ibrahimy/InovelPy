Novelty indicators
------------

Here are the novelty indicators we currently support:

Uzzi et al. [2013]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of the measure proposed by Uzzi et al. [2013] :cite:p:`uzzi2013atypical` is to compare an observed network (co-occurrence matrix) with a random network where edges are rearranged randomly at a year level.

   :width: 250
   :align: center

P and P’ are two distinct papers; P cites journals A, B and D. P’ cites journals B, C and E. The goal is to shuffle the
network by conserving the dynamic structure of citations at the paper level. P is no longer citing A from :math:`t − y` but instead cites B from year :math:`t − y`. Comparing the observed and resampled networks, we can compute a z-score for each journal
combination.

.. py:function:: Uzzi2013(collection_name, id_variable, year_variable, variable, sub_variable, focal_year, client_name = None, db_name = None, nb_sample = 20, density = False)

   Compute the novelty score for every paper for the focal_year based on Uzzi et al. 2013 

   :param str collection_name: Name of the collection or the JSON file containing the variable.  
   :param str id_variable: Name of the key whose value gives the document's identity.
   :param str year_variable: Name of the key whose value is the year of creation of the document.
   :param str variable: Name of the key that holds the variable of interest used in combinations.
   :param str sub_variable: Name of the key which holds the ID of the variable of interest (nested dict in variable).
   :param int focal_year: Calculate the novelty score for every document with a year_variable = focal_year.
   :param str client_name: Mongo URI if the data are hosted on a MongoDB instead of a JSON file.
   :param str db_name: Name of the MongoDB.
   :param int nb_sample: Number of resampling of the co-occurrence matrix.
   :param bool density: If True, save an array where each cell is the score of a combination. If False, save only the percentile of this array

   :return: 

   :raises ValueError: 
   :raises TypeError: 


In order to run Atypicality, one first needs to create a co-occurrence matrix with self-loop = True and weighted_network = True; read more in :ref:`Usage:tutorial` and :ref:`Utils:cooc_utils`

Foster et al. [2015]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Foster et al. [2015] :cite:p:`foster2015tradition` define novelty as an inter-community combination. A combination has a novelty score of 1 if the two items are not in the same community. The original paper used the infomap community detection algorithm. More recently, Foster et al. [2021] :cite:p:`foster2021surprise` used the Louvain algorithm. Currently, only Louvain is supported; see the :ref:`roadmap` section. The score for a given entity is the proportion of novel combinations on the total number of combination.

   Foster.get_indicator()








Lee et al. [2015]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lee et al. [2015] :cite:p:`lee2015creativity` compare the observed number of combinations with the theoretical number of combinations between two items. The higher (lower) the observed (theoretical) number of combinations, the more novel the paper is. They call this measure "commonness".

Wang et al. [2017]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wang et al. [2017] :cite:p:`wang2017bias` proposed a measure of difficulty on pair of references that were never made before, but that are reused after the given publication’s year (Scholars do not have to cite directly the paper that created the combination but only the combination itself). The idea is to compute the cosine similarity for each journal combination based on their co-citation profile b years before t.
