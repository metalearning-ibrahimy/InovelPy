Welcome to Novelpy's documentation!
===================================

**Novelpy** is a Python library for scientometrician but also anyone that is interested in computing novelty and disruptiveness indicators. Scholars have proposed alternative measurements to complete citation indicators which capture documents’ creativity, usually called “atypicality”, “originality” or “novelty” indicators. Every indicator is detailed in :doc:`indicators`. A paper will also be available soon for this package, explaining the idea and the maths behind each indicator. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`installation` the package.
